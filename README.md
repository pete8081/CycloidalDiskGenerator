# CycloidalDiskGenerator
Fusion 360 add-in script to generate cycloidal disk profiles. Still a WIP

This add-in builds upon the rotechnic script which generates a single "lobe" of a cycloidal disk. (https://github.com/roTechnic/CycloidalDesign)
Instead of generating a single lobe this add-in builds the entire profile of the disk, adds the center hole, and more easily allows for user defined parameters right from the script. In the future this add-in will allow more functionality as outlined in the "TODO" section below.

TODO
* Generate Pin Arangement
* Generate "Base plate" for pin arangement
* Extrude cycloidal disk by user defined amount and add holes for roller arangement 
* Generate eccentric cam + carrier
